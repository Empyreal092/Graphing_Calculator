# Graphing Calculator

This application is a graphic calculator. It can solve Ordinary Differential Equations and Two Point Boundary Value Problems. 

This project is on Github at [Graphing_Calculator](https://github.com/Empyreal092/Graphing_Calculator).

## Motivation

It has three main functionalities:
 - Plotting Function
 - Graphically solving (Autonomous) Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)
 - Graphically solving Two Point Boundary Value Problem
 
## Features

- Plotting Function
- Graphically solving (Autonomous) Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) with the folloing methods
  - Eulerâ€™s Method
  - Backward Euler Method
  - 2nd Order Runge-Kutta Method
  - 4th Order Runge-Kutta Method
  - Trapezoidal Method
- Graphically solving Two Point Boundary Value Problem (with  Dirichlet boundary conditions)

## Prerequisites

Developed using Qt Creator 4.8.0 (Community). Building using compiler Qt 5.12.0 MSVC2017 (64bit) and Qt 5.12.0 clang (64bit)

## Potential Compiling Error

This section is about possible reasons for the code fail to compile in other Environment and possible directions to solve them.

### FLAG: /bigobj

If the error message mentions `exceed limit`, `file too big` or `bigobj` in some way, then these lines in `"Graphing_Calculator.pro"` might be the source of trouble. 
```prolog
# Prevents "fatal error C1128: number of sections exceeded object file format limit".
win32-msvc : QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += /bigobj
win32-g++ : QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -Wa,-mbig-obj
```
Unfortunatly these lines must be there because `Exprtk.hpp` exceed the default build limit of certain compiler and these lines allow us to exceed that limit. Make sure to use the setting stated in **Prerequisites** to avoid the error. If you are using other compilers and the error appear, try to find ways to allow the build to exceed the build limit. You could also try commenting out those lines but we are pretty confident that those commands are restricted so that they only apply to the correct situation. 

Here are some links that I found useful when I was trying to solve this problem:
- [/bigobj Flag for MSVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/bigobj-increase-number-of-sections-in-dot-obj-file?view=vs-2017)
- [How to refer to certain compiler (the section about QMAKESPEC)](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmake-environment-reference.html)
- [Qt Documentation about QtProject file, specifically: `QMAKE_CXXFLAGS`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmake-variable-reference.html)
- [A thread on how to add the bigobj flag for WinGW](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16596876/object-file-has-too-many-sections)
- [But program still cannot compile using WinGW, ran into problem similar to this post](http://mingw-users.1079350.n2.nabble.com/File-too-big-too-many-sections-td7579168.html)

### Cannot find file

You might see an error like `:-1: error: dependent '..\Graphing_Calculator-master\FunctionPlotWindows\...\...\...' does not exist.` This error is because there is a certain limit on how long a file path (DOS notation) could be. Our folder names plus file names might exceed that limit. The easiest way to solve this problem is by reducing the lenghth of the outmost folder name, e.g.: change `Graphing_Calculator-master` to `GC_m`. 

## Packages used
 
- [Exprtk](https://github.com/ArashPartow/exprtk)
  - Exprtk enables us to read the function (e.g.: y = sin(t) ) user entered (as a string). When given a value (e.g.: t=2), it evaluates the value of the function at that point (e.g.: gives us sin(2) ).
- [QCustomPlot](https://www.qcustomplot.com/)
  - Qt class for plotting function. 
  
## Numerical Methods

The Numerical Methods used in the program is based on the Math 151B course (Winder 2019), taught by Professor [Chris Anderson](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~anderson/). The textbook used in the course is *Numerical Analysis* by Burden and Faires (10th edition).

## Future Planned Features

- Be able to solve system of first order ODE.
- Be able to solve non-automonous ODE.
- Give user more options for parameters. (E.g.: change tolerence for in Secant methods and Gauss-Seidel methods).
- Represent error bounds on the graph.
