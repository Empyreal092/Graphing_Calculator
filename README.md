# PIC10C Final_Project: Graphic Calculator

Our project will be a graphing calculator. The calculator will be able to graph functions of one variable. Based on that, we plan to implement the graphical representation of Euler’s method to solve an Ordinary Differential Equation, Newton’s method to find the root of a function, and Polynomial Interpolation. We may include more basic calculator functions later. At the start of the application, users will be greeted by a welcome page and asked to choose from three of the functionalities (Sketch 1). After users make their choice, they will be brought to the graphics calculator interface. The left of the window is where users will input the function and parameters, and the right of the window is where the graph will be drawn (Sketch 2). Users will input the functions and parameters like endpoints and step size (parameters will be different for different method) and the program will show the graphical representation of the numerical methods based on those inputs. Users have the ability to set graphics options like background color and line color. Users will also be able to hold graph and draw new graphs on the old one to compare graphs. 

**A Temporary Schedule:**

Week 3: Sketch the design of the program and Welcome page (Buttons for three functionalities)

Week 4: Calculator interface (Basic input reading and graphing function)

Week 5: Calculator interface (More user input and graphics options)

Week 6: Implement Euler’s method 

Week 7: Implement Newton’s method

Week 8: Implement polynomial interpolation

Week 9: Final check

Week 10: Presentations
