# Graphic Calculator

This application is a graphic calculator. It can solve Ordinary Differential Equations and Two Point Boundary Value Problems.

## Motivation

It has three main functionalities:
 - Plotting Function
 - Graphically solving (Autonomous) Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)
 - Graphically solving Two Point Boundary Value Problem
