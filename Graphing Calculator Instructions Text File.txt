Main Window

• The main window has three features that users can select from

   1. Plot Function

   2. ODE Solver

   3. Two Point Boundary Value Problem

   - After selecting one of these buttons, a new window corresponding to the selected feature will appear

• On the top of the main window is a menu bar that contains two menu buttons, "Help?" and "About"
   
   - The "Help?" button allows you to click on the "Instructions" button which will display a text file with 
     the instructions for this program

   - The "About" buttons allows you to click on the "Credits" button which will display a credits window
     that shows the contributors of the "Graphing Calculator" program
------------------------------------------------
Plot Function

• The "Plotting Function" window allows users to plot a regular function in terms of t.

• On the top of the "Plotting Function" window is a menu bar that contains the menu button, "Help?"

  - The "Help?" button in the menu bar allows you to click on the "Instructions" button which will 
    display a text file with the instructions for this program

• In order to plot a function, follow the steps below:

   1. Input a function in terms of t into the white box on the left side of the graph with the text "y(t) := " 
       to the left of the white box

   2. Enter the initial and final values of t using the increment and decrement buttons on the "t initial" 
       box, and the "t final" box or manually enter the initial and final values of t into the "t initial" box and 
       the "t final" box

       - This will set the range of the t axis on the graph

   3. Enter the number of steps used for the graph using the increment and decrement buttons on the 
       "Num of steps" box, or manually enter the number of steps used for the graph into the "Num of 
       steps" box.

   4. Click on the green "Plot!" button or press "Enter" on the keyboard to plot the graph.

       - The graph of the inputted function will have a random color and a legend will apear on the graph 
         that represents which color corresponds to which function on the graph. This allows for multiple
         functions to be graphed.

   5. Click on the red "Clear!" button or press "CTRL + Enter" on the keyboard to clear all graphs from
       the graph
------------------------------------------------
ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) Solver

• The ODE solver contains five different methods to plot a first-order ordinary differential equation in 
   terms of y
   
   1. Euler's Method

   2. Backward Euler's Method

   3. 2nd Order Runge-Kutta Method
   
   4. 4th Order Runge-Kutta Method
   
   5. Trapezoidal Method

• The ODE solver starts with the "Euler's Method" window

• On the top of the "Euler's Method" window is a menu bar that contains two menu buttons, "Method
  Selection" and "Help?"

   - The "Method Selection" button contains the five different methods used to plot an ordinary
      differential equation and users can select one of the five different methods to use the chosen method 
     
   - The "Help?" button in the menu bar allows you to click on the "Instructions" button which will 
     display a text file with the instructions for this program

• After selecting one of the methods to plot a first-order ordinary differential equation, follow the steps 
  below:

   1. Input a first-order ordinary differential equation in terms of y into the white box on the left side of 
       the graph with the text "dy/dt := " to the left of the white box

   2. Enter the initial and final values of t using the increment and decrement buttons on the "t initial" 
       box, and the "t final" box or manually enter the initial and final values of t into the "t initial" box and 
       the "t final" box

       - This will set the range of the t axis on the graph

   3. Enter the number of steps used for the graph using the increment and decrement buttons on the 
       "Num of steps" box, or manually enter the number of steps used for the graph into the "Num of 
       steps" box.

   5. Click on the green "Plot!" button or press "Enter" on the keyboard to plot the graph.

       - The graph of the inputted function will have a random color and a legend will apear on the graph 
         that represents which color corresponds to which first-order ordinary differential equation on the 
         graph. This allows for multiple functions to be graphed.

   6. Click on the red "Clear!" button or press "CTRL + Enter" on the keyboard to clear all graphs from
       the graph

Two Point Boundary Value Problem

• The "Two Point Boundary Value Problem Solver" window allows users to plot a second-order ordinary
   differential equation in terms of t.

• In order to plot a second-order ordinary differential equation, follow the steps below:

   1. Input a second-order ordinary differential equation in terms of t into the white box on the left side of 
       the graph with the text "d2y/dt2 := " to the left of the white box

   2. Enter the initial and final values of t using the increment and decrement buttons on the "t initial" 
       box, and the "t final" box or manually enter the initial and final values of t into the "t initial" box and 
       the "t final" box

       - This will set the range of the t axis on the graph

   3. Enter the number of steps used for the graph using the increment and decrement buttons on the 
       "Num of steps" box, or manually enter the number of steps used for the graph into the "Num of 
       steps" box.

   4. /* Initial Condition Instructions */

   5. Click on the green "Plot!" button or press "Enter" on the keyboard to plot the graph.

       - The graph of the inputted function will have a random color and a legend will apear on the graph 
         that represents which color corresponds to which function on the graph. This allows for multiple
         functions to be graphed.

   6. Click on the red "Clear!" button or press "CTRL + Enter" on the keyboard to clear all graphs from
       the graph
